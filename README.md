# Expanding Cards

This is a simple web application designed to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. The application allows users to click on an image, which will expand the selected image while contracting any other expanded images.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Uses basic HTML and CSS for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Implements functionality to expand the clicked image and contract all other images.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clean, simple code, making it suitable for those learning front-end web development.

## How It Works

- The page displays a collection of images.
- When a user clicks on an image, the selected image expands.
- Any previously expanded images automatically contract, ensuring only one image is expanded at a time.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the web page and the image elements.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the images, including the default and expanded states.
- **JavaScript**: Adds the interactive behavior of expanding and contracting the images based on user clicks.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Click on any image to see the expand/contract functionality in action.
